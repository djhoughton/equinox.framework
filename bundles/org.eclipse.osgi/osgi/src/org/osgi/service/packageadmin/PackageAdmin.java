     * The technique by which this is accomplished
     * may vary among different Framework implementations. One permissible
     * implementation is to stop and restart the Framework.
     *
     * <p> This method returns to the caller immediately and then performs the
     * following steps in its own thread:
     *
     * <ol>
     * <li> Compute a graph of bundles starting with the specified bundles. If no
     * bundles are specified, compute a graph of bundles starting with
     * previously updated or uninstalled ones.
     * Add to the graph any bundle that imports a package that is currently exported
     * by a bundle in the graph. The graph is fully
     * constructed when there is no bundle outside the graph that imports a
     * package from a bundle in the graph. The graph may contain
     * <tt>UNINSTALLED</tt> bundles that are currently still
     * exporting packages.
     *
     * <li> Each bundle in the graph that is in the <tt>ACTIVE</tt> state
     * will be stopped as described in the <tt>Bundle.stop</tt> method.
     *
     * <li> Each bundle in the graph that is in the
     * <tt>RESOLVED</tt> state is moved
     * to the <tt>INSTALLED</tt> state.
     * The effect of this step is that bundles in the graph are no longer
     * <tt>RESOLVED</tt>.
     *
     * <li> Each bundle in the graph that is in the <tt>UNINSTALLED</tt> state is
     * removed from the graph and is now completely removed from the Framework.
     *
     * <li> Each bundle in the graph that was in the
     * <tt>ACTIVE</tt> state prior to Step 2 is started as
     * described in the <tt>Bundle.start</tt> method, causing all
     * bundles required for the restart to be resolved.
     * It is possible that, as a
     * result of the previous steps, packages that were
     * previously exported no longer are. Therefore, some bundles
     * may be unresolvable until another bundle
     * offering a compatible package for export has been installed in the
     * Framework.
     * <li>A framework event of type <tt>FrameworkEvent.PACKAGES_REFRESHED</tt> is broadcast.
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>For any exceptions that are thrown during any of these steps, a
     * <tt>FrameworkEvent</tt> of type <tt>ERROR</tt> is
     * broadcast, containing the exception.
     * The source bundle for these events should be the specific bundle
     * to which the exception is related. If no specific bundle can be
     * associated with the exception then the System Bundle must be used
     * as the source bundle for the event.

     * @param bundles the bundles whose exported packages are to be updated or
     * removed, or <tt>null</tt> for all previously updated or uninstalled bundles.
